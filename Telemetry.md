# Telemetry 

Our telemetry system would comprise of surveys which the user would need to answer for us (after using our application).  
The telemetry surveys would be of _two_ types:  
1. _Technical Survery:_ This would comprise of the technical evaluation parameters defined in our evaluation plan.  
2. _Feedback Survery:_ This would comprise of the qualitative user feedback parameters defined in our evaluation plan.  

We would include a link of these surveys with our application and the links would also be displayed in our application asking the users to complete the survey for us. Further, we would be pushing out a README into our git repo comprising of the surveys and the link for downloading our application. We are aiming to achieve an efficient data collection through this process.
