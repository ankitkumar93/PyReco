It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function (and as such is callable).

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148a912ccff05da976874"},"Body":"Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found here.\nIt grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:\nprint tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1\nWhat is the \"best\" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?\nI originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\" without having to do if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = [] and so on)\nThen I just stored the data by doing self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\"\nThis worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)\nCurrently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a __setitem__, __getitem_ and has_key\nThis works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.\nThe problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the _getitem_ and _setitem_ functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call _getitem_ (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)\nThe other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..\nI think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data?

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148a912ccff05da976926"},"Body":"I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.\nHowever, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.\nFor example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):\nif foo:\n   bar = baz\n   while bar not biz:\n      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()\n\ndid_i_not_warn_you_biz()\nmy_father_is_avenged()\n\nThe problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:\nif foo:\n   bar = baz\n   while bar not biz:\n      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()\n   #-- while --\n#-- if --\n\ndid_i_not_warn_you_biz()\nmy_father_is_avenged()\n\nAnd this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.\n","CommentCount":"0","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003creadability\u003e","Title":"Improving Python readability?","AnswerCount":"7","AcceptedAnswerId":"52090","Score":"2","ViewCount":"1889","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"1","Id":"51502"}

Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):\nSELECT count(id), avg(a), avg(b), avg(c), avg(d) FROM tuples;\n\nIs this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?\nThe schema (the table holds responses to a survey):\nCREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);\n\n\\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','\n\nI wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):\njava   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    \njava   1.5         ~ 10 ms    \npython 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  \npython 2.5         ~ 370 ms\n\nEven sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)\nTunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):\nincreased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    \nincreased the working memory to 2MB\ndisabled connection and statement logging\nused a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ...

I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. \nIs there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.\n\nNo the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.\nThe sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)\nI realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.\nThe Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.\nI've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)\n","ViewCount":"3794","LastEditorDisplayName":"Jacob Rigby","Title":"Why are SQL aggregate functions so much slower than Python and Java (or Poor Man's OLAP)","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003csql\u003e\u003coptimization\u003e\u003caggregate\u003e\u003colap\u003e","CommentCount":"1","AnswerCount":"10","AcceptedAnswerId":"52006","Score":"10","OwnerDisplayName":"Jacob Rigby","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"5","Id":"51553"}

Most of the demo apps I've seen resolve template paths like this:\npath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'myPage.html')\n\n...the __ file __ property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllers/controller1/, then the 'myPage.html' would resolve to that same directory -- controllers/controller1/myPage.html -- and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.\nThe solution I've hacked together feels... hacky:\nbase_paths = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))\ntemplate_dir = os.path.join(base_paths[0], \"templates\")\n\nSo, I'm just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.

You simply do theList.sort().\nThis is O(n * log(n)) string comparisons and no memory management (since all\nstrings and list elements are some sort of smart pointers). You are happy.\nNow, you want to do the same, but ignore the case (let's simplify and say\nall strings are ascii, so locale issues can be ignored).\nYou can do theList.sort(key=lambda s: s.lower()), but then you cause two new \nallocations per comparison, plus burden the garbage-collector with the duplicated\n(lowered) strings. \nEach such memory-management noise is orders-of-magnitude slower than simple string comparison.\nNow, with an in-place stricmp()-like function, you do: theList.sort(cmp=stricmp)\nand it is as fast and as memory-friendly as theList.sort(). You are happy again.\nThe problem is any Python-based case-insensitive comparison involves implicit string \nduplications, so I was expecting to find a C-based comparisons (maybe in module string).\nCould not find anything like that, hence the question here.\n(Hope this clarifies the question).\n","ViewCount":"72303","LastEditorDisplayName":"ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ","Title":"Ignore case in Python strings","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cstring\u003e\u003ccase-insensitive\u003e","CommentCount":"4","AnswerCount":"16","AcceptedAnswerId":"66547","Score":"41","OwnerDisplayName":"Paul Oyster","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"17","Id":"62567"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148a912ccff05da976996"},"Body":"Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).\nI chose a mocking library called mocker. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.\nAnyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:\ndef test_current_window_controller():\n    def test(config):\n        ac = AppController()\n        m = Mocker()\n        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)\n        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))\n        with m:\n            result = ac.current_window_controller()\n            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)\n    yield test, []\n    yield test, [0]\n    yield test, [1, 0]\n\nNotice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:\ndef current_window_controller(self):\n    try:\n        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting\n        # with the controller of the top-most window\n        # assumption: the top-most window is the \"current\" one\n        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()\n    except StopIteration:\n        return None\n    return wc\n\nOne of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.\nI find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.\nI'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?\nAm I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?\n","ViewCount":"1053","LastEditorDisplayName":"Daniel","Title":"Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cunit-testing\u003e\u003cuser-interface\u003e\u003ctdd\u003e","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"3","Score":"4","OwnerDisplayName":"Daniel","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"1","Id":"79454"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148a912ccff05da9769b0"},"Body":"We are mainting a web application that is built on Classic ASP using VBScript as the primary language. We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.\nCurrently there are two paths being discussed:\n\nPort the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.\nCompletely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.\n\nThis does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.\nNow, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above?

It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:\n#in Tool\ndef render(self, screen):\n    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)\n\n#in Scroll\ndef render(self, screen, image, odePos):\n    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)\n    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious\n\ndef odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):\n    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset\n    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)\n\ndef odeToPixels(odeUnits):\n    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)\n\nWhew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... \nThe problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.\nIt starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.\nAdditionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.\nAt some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.\nIt's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.\nBest guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.\nAnyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?\n","ViewCount":"2295","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cgraphics\u003e\u003cgrid\u003e\u003csnap-framework\u003e","Title":"What is wrong with my snap to grid code?","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"3","AcceptedAnswerId":"119022","Score":"0","OwnerDisplayName":"travis","PostTypeId":"1","Id":"118540"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148aa12ccff05da976a71"},"Body":"Greetings, currently I am refactoring one of my programs, and I found an interesting problem.\nI have Transitions in an automata. Transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. Some Transitions have a label, which encodes a certain Action that must be performed upon traversal. No label means no action. Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.\nI need the following operations:  \n\ncheck if the transition has a label\nget this label\nadd a label to a transition\ncheck if the transition has a condition \nget this condition\ncheck for equality\n\nJudging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition. However, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(\"foo\", Conditional(\"bar\", Transition(\"baz\", \"qux\"))) and Conditional(\"bar\", Labeled(\"foo\", Transition(\"baz\", \"qux\"))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:\nclass Transition(object):\n    def __init__(self, start, end):\n        self.start = start\n        self.end = end\n    def get_label(self):\n        return None\n    def has_label(self):\n        return False\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\n        return decorations\n    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):\n        try:\n            return (self.start == other.start\n                    and self.end == other.end\n                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)\n\nclass Labeled(object):\n    def __init__(self, label, base):\n        self.base = base\n        self.label = label\n    def has_label(self):\n        return True\n    def get_label(self):\n        return self.label\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\n        assert 'label' not in decorations\n        decorations['label'] = self.label\n        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)\n    def __getattr__(self, attribute):\n        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)\n\nIs this a clean approach? Am I missing something?\nI am mostly confused, because I can solve this - with longer class names - using cooperative multiple inheritance:\nclass Transition(object):\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        # init is pythons MI-madness ;-)\n        super(Transition, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.start = kwargs['start']\n        self.end = kwargs['end']\n    def get_label(self):\n        return None\n    def get_condition(self):\n        return None\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        try:\n            return self.start == other.start and self.end == other.end\n        except AttributeError:\n            return False\n\nclass LabeledTransition(Transition):\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        super(LabeledTransition).__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.label = kwargs['label']\n    def get_label(self):\n        return self.label\n    def __eq__(self):\n        super_result = super(LabeledTransition, self).__eq__(other)\n        try:\n            return super_result and self.label == other.label\n        except AttributeError:\n            return False\n\nclass ConditionalTransition(Transition):\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        super(ConditionalTransition, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.condition = kwargs['condition']\n\n    def get_condition(self):\n        return self.condition\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        super_result = super(ConditionalTransition, self).__eq__(other)\n        try:\n            return super_result and self.condition = other.condition\n        except AttributeError:\n            return False\n\n# ConditionalTransition about the same, with get_condition\nclass LabeledConditionalTransition(LabeledTransition, ConditionalTransition):\n    pass\n\nthe class LabledConditionalTransition behaves exactly as expected - and having no code in there is appealing and I do not thing MI is confusing at this size.\nOf course, the third option would be to just hammer everything into a single transition class with a bunch of in has_label/has_transition.\nSo... I am confused. Am I missing something? Which implementation looks better?

In each group there could be multiples of the same id, each coming from different files. I don't care about the duplicates, so I thought that a nice way to store all of this would be to throw it into a Set type. But there's a problem.\nSometimes for the same id the descriptions can vary slightly, as follows:\nIPI00110753\n\nTubulin alpha-1A chain\nTubulin alpha-1 chain\nAlpha-tubulin 1\nAlpha-tubulin isotype M-alpha-1\n\n(Note that this example is taken from the uniprot protein database.) \nI don't care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.\nI am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don't really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID's). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID's go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.\nI have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven't thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? \nThank you for reading my question, \nTim\nUpdate\nbased on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. \nRight now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?\n*The information is a list of Swiss-Prot protein identifiers that I get by querying uniprot.\n","ViewCount":"3493","LastEditorDisplayName":"tim.tadh","Title":"What is the best way to store set data in Python?","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cdictionary\u003e\u003cdata-structures\u003e\u003cset\u003e","CommentCount":"1","AnswerCount":"6","Score":"4","OwnerDisplayName":"tim.tadh","PostTypeId":"1","Id":"128259"}

The servers will communicate with each other in a cluster. Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table. The exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning, and it's important that it's possible for the person running the cluster (eg, myself) to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server.\nSimply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.\nWhat I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.\nThe interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression. You can also concatenate multiple independent result sets together.\nI realise this question sounds a lot like I'm asking for SQL. However, I don't want to require that the datastore backing this data be a relational database, and I don't want the overhead of trying to reimplement SQL myself. I'm also dealing with only a single table with a known schema. Finally, no joins will be required.

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148aa12ccff05da976aaf"},"Body":"We're using a third-party middleware product that allows us to write code in an embedded Python interpreter, and which exposes an API that we can call into. Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.\nWe've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:\nimport locale\nlocale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )\n\nNow, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.\nWe can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:\nimport locale\ncurrentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )\nlocale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )\ndisplayNumbersToTheUser()\nlocale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )\n\nThis seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.\nAny information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.\n","ViewCount":"1365","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cinternationalization\u003e\u003clocale\u003e","Title":"Using locale.setlocale in embedded Python without breaking file parsing in C thread","CommentCount":"2","AnswerCount":"1","AcceptedAnswerId":"142802","Score":"2","OwnerDisplayName":"MegaHAL","PostTypeId":"1","Id":"140295"}

For example, it might convert all arguments to a specific type, perform logging, implement memoization, etc.\nHere is an example:\n\ndef args_as_ints(f):\n    def g(*args, **kwargs):\n        args = [int(x) for x in args]\n        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n    return g\n\n@args_as_ints\ndef funny_function(x, y, z=3):\n    \"\"\"Computes x*y + 2*z\"\"\"\n    return x*y + 2*z\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e funny_function(\"3\", 4.0, z=\"5\")\n22\n\nEverything well so far. There is one problem, however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e help(funny_function)\nHelp on function g in module __main__:\n\ng(*args, **kwargs)\n\nFortunately, there is a workaround:\n\ndef args_as_ints(f):\n    def g(*args, **kwargs):\n        args = [int(x) for x in args]\n        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\n    return g\n\n@args_as_ints\ndef funny_function(x, y, z=3):\n    \"\"\"Computes x*y + 2*z\"\"\"\n    return x*y + 2*z\n\nThis time, the function name and documentation are correct:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e help(funny_function)\nHelp on function funny_function in module __main__:\n\nfunny_function(*args, **kwargs)\n    Computes x*y + 2*z\n\nBut there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information \"*args, **kwargs\" is next to useless.\nWhat to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:\n1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:\n\ndef funny_function(x, y, z=3):\n    \"\"\"funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z\"\"\"\n    return x*y + 2*z\n\nThis is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.]\n2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:\n\ndef funny_functions_decorator(f):\n    def g(x, y, z=3):\n        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\n    return g\n\nThis works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.\nI'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.\nSo the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?\nOtherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of \"*kwargs, **kwargs\" when constructing the decorated function?

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148aa12ccff05da976aec"},"Body":"I have a small web server application I've written in Python that goes and gets some data from a database system and returns it to the user as XML. That part works fine - I can run the Python web server application from the command line and I can have clients connect to it and get data back. At the moment, to run the web server I have to be logged in to our server as the administrator user and I have to manually start the web server. I want to have the web server automatically start on system start as a service and run in the background.\nUsing code from ActiveState's site and StackOverflow, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:\nserver = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)\nserver.serve_forever()\n\nThe serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a \"stop\" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:\ndef SvcStop(self):\n    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)\n    exit(0)\n\nWhich seems to get called when I do \"python myservice stop\" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to \"python myservice start\" gives me an error:\n\nError starting service: An instance of\n  the service is already running.\n\nand subsequent calls to stop gives me:\n\nError stopping service: The service\n  cannot accept control messages at this\n  time. (1061)\n\nI think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.\nHere's a full listing (I've trimmed includes/comments to save space):\nclass SIMSAPIServerHandler(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        try:\n            reportTuple = self.path.partition(\"/\")\n            if len(reportTuple) \u003c 3:\n                return\n            if reportTuple[2] == \"\":\n                return\n            os.system(\"C:\\\\Programs\\\\SIMSAPI\\\\runCommandReporter.bat \" + reportTuple[2])\n            f = open(\"C:\\\\Programs\\\\SIMSAPI\\\\out.xml\", \"rb\")\n            self.send_response(200)\n            self.send_header('Content-type', \"application/xml\")\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(f.read())\n            f.close()\n            # The output from CommandReporter is simply dumped to out.xml, which we read, write to the user, then remove.\n            os.unlink(\"C:\\\\Programs\\\\SIMSAPI\\\\out.xml\")\n            return\n        except IOError:\n            self.send_error(404,'File Not Found: %s' % self.path)\n\n\n\nclass SIMSAPI(win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework):\n    _svc_name_ = \"SIMSAPI\"\n    _svc_display_name_ = \"A simple web server\"\n    _svc_description_ = \"Serves XML data produced by SIMS CommandReporter\"\n\n    def __init__(self, args):\n        win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework.__init__(self, args)\n        self.hWaitStop = win32event.CreateEvent(None, 0, 0, None)           \n\n    def SvcStop(self):\n            self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)\n            exit(0)\n\n    def SvcDoRun(self):\n        import servicemanager\n        servicemanager.LogMsg(servicemanager.EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE,servicemanager.PYS_SERVICE_STARTED,(self._svc_name_, '')) \n\n        self.timeout = 3000\n\n        while 1:\n            server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)\n            server.serve_forever()\n\ndef ctrlHandler(ctrlType):\n    return True\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    win32api.SetConsoleCtrlHandler(ctrlHandler, True)\n    win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine(SIMSAPI)\n\n","ViewCount":"3622","Title":"Runnning a Python web server as a service in Windows","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cwindows\u003e\u003cwebserver\u003e","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"1","AcceptedAnswerId":"154660","Score":"5","OwnerDisplayName":"David Hicks","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"5","Id":"153221"}

One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.\nI'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.

I am willing to use beta code and such but by January, I'd like a site that doesn't have 'strange' problems.  With that said, if a language is simply 10% slower than another, I don't care about those things as long as the issue is linear.  My main concern is developer productivity.\nI'll be using Linux, Apache, MySQL for the application.\nI want the power to do things like run scp and ftp client functions with stable libraries (I only picked those two because they're not web-related but at the same time represent pretty common network protocols that any larger app might use).  Technologies like OpenID and Oauth will be used as well.\nExperienced web developers are readily available (i.e. I don't have to find people from financial companies and such).\nWhatever the choice is is common and will be around for a while.\nHere's a kicker.  I'd like to be able to use advanced presentation layer tools/languages similar to HAML, SASS.  I definitively want to use JQuery.\nI will be creating a Facebook app and at some point doing things like dealing with SMS messages, iPhone apps, etc...\n\nAt this point, the choices for language are PHP (Cake,Symfony,Zend), Python (Django), Ruby (Merb).

If the working directory is dynamically constructed with buildout, it can't be a live SVN directory from which I can check the changes back into the repository?\nHave I misunderstood how buildout is meant to be used?

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148ab12ccff05da976bf5"},"Body":"I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form ${expr}, for example, where expr is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with compile(), evaluate it against a particular scope with eval(), and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.\nI could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of expr is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any expr that has balanced curly braces.\nWhat's your sense?\nUpdate:\nThanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.\nThe ${expr} syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used $(expr) as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of re.finditer(r'$\\{([^}]+)\\}', s), a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the ) (or }) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!\nPrior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.\nThanks for your patience!\n","ViewCount":"748","LastEditorDisplayName":"zaphod","Title":"extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cparsing\u003e","CommunityOwnedDate":"2008-10-16T03:02:27.847","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"4","AcceptedAnswerId":"207310","Score":"1","OwnerDisplayName":"zaphod","PostTypeId":"1","Id":"207290"}

(Or use if/else statements, whichever is better).\nI created a test script to see if my logic is correct but it's not working. When I create the try statement, it just creates a new database rather than checking if one already exists. The next time I run the script, I get an error that the table already exists, even if I tried catching the exception. (I haven't used try/except before but figured this is a good time to learn).\nAre there any good tutorials for using SQLite operationally or any suggestions on how to code this? I've looked through the pysqlite tutorial and others I found but they don't address this.\n","ViewCount":"23701","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cexception\u003e\u003csqlite\u003e","Title":"Using SQLite in a Python program","CommentCount":"1","AnswerCount":"8","AcceptedAnswerId":"211534","Score":"12","OwnerDisplayName":"crystalattice","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"4","Id":"211501"}

Thus far I've structured my project this way:\n\napplication.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)\ngui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.\ncommand.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class\nstate.py - holds the state data persistence class\n\nThis has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.\nI have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.\nShould I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?\nEDIT I\nOk, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.\nShould I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)?

Ideally I'd like to call functions which have already been wrapped from Python, but if that's not possible, I'm not above a little bit of C or ctypes code, as long as I know what I'm actually looking for.\nOn Windows I think the function I want is GetLastInputInfo, but that doesn't seem to be wrapped by pywin32; I hope I'm missing something.\n","ViewCount":"2248","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cwinapi\u003e\u003cgtk\u003e\u003cpygtk\u003e\u003cpywin32\u003e","Title":"How can I determine the display idle time from Python in Windows, Linux, and MacOS?","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"3","AcceptedAnswerId":"1145688","Score":"13","OwnerDisplayName":"Glyph","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"12","Id":"217157"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"56d148ab12ccff05da976c37"},"Body":"I've written a setup.py script for py2exe, generated an executable for my python GUI application and I have a whole bunch of files in the dist directory, including the app, w9xopen.exe and MSVCR71.dll. When I try to run the application, I get an error message that just says \"see the logfile for details\". The only problem is, the log file is empty. \nThe closest error I've seen is \"The following modules appear to be missing\" but I'm not using any of those modules as far as I know (especially since they seem to be of databases I'm not using) but digging up on Google suggests that these are relatively benign warnings.\nI've written and packaged a console application as well as a wxpython one with py2exe and both applications have compiled and run successfully. I am using a new python toolkit called dabo, which in turn makes uses of wxpython modules so I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Where do I start investigating the problem since obviously the log file hasn't been too useful?   \nEdit 1: \nThe python version is 2.5. py2exe is 0.6.8. There were no significant build errors. The only one was the bit about \"The following modules appear to be missing...\" which were non critical errors since the packages listed were ones I was definitely not using and shouldn't stop the execution of the app either. Running the executable produced a logfile which was completely empty. Previously it had an error about locales which I've since fixed but clearly something is wrong as the executable wasn't running. The setup.py file is based quite heavily on the original setup.py generated by running their \"app wizard\" and looking at the example that Ed Leafe and some others posted. Yes, I have a log file and it's not printing anything for me to use, which is why I'm asking if there's any other troubleshooting avenue I've missed which will help me find out what's going on. \nI have even written a bare bones test application which simply produces a bare bones GUI - an empty frame with some default menu options. The code written itself is only 3 lines and the rest is in the 3rd party toolkit. Again, that compiled into an exe (as did my original app) but simply did not run. There were no error output in the run time log file either. \nEdit 2:\nIt turns out that switching from \"windows\" to \"console\" for initial debugging purposes was insightful. I've now got a basic running test app and on to compiling the real app! \nThe test app:\n\nimport dabo\napp = dabo.dApp()\napp.start()\n\nThe setup.py for test app:\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport glob\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nimport py2exe\nimport dabo.icons\ndaboDir = os.path.split(dabo.__file__)[0]\n\n# Find the location of the dabo icons:\niconDir = os.path.split(dabo.icons.__file__)[0]\niconSubDirs = []\ndef getIconSubDir(arg, dirname, fnames):\n    if \".svn\" not in dirname and dirname[-1] != \"\\\\\":\n     icons = glob.glob(os.path.join(dirname, \"*.png\"))\n     if icons:\n      subdir = (os.path.join(\"resources\", dirname[len(arg)+1:]), icons)\n      iconSubDirs.append(subdir)\nos.path.walk(iconDir, getIconSubDir, iconDir)\n\n# locales:\nlocaleDir = \"%s%slocale\" % (daboDir, os.sep)\nlocales = []\ndef getLocales(arg, dirname, fnames):\n  if \".svn\" not in dirname and dirname[-1] != \"\\\\\":\n    mo_files = tuple(glob.glob(os.path.join(dirname, \"*.mo\")))\n    if mo_files:\n      subdir = os.path.join(\"dabo.locale\", dirname[len(arg)+1:])\n      locales.append((subdir, mo_files))\nos.path.walk(localeDir, getLocales, localeDir)\n\ndata_files=[(\"resources\", glob.glob(os.path.join(iconDir, \"*.ico\"))),\n     (\"resources\", glob.glob(\"resources/*\"))]\ndata_files.extend(iconSubDirs)\ndata_files.extend(locales)\n\nsetup(name=\"basicApp\",\n        version='0.01',\n        description=\"Test Dabo Application\",\n        options={\"py2exe\": {\n                \"compressed\": 1, \"optimize\": 2, \"bundle_files\": 1,\n                \"excludes\": [\"Tkconstants\",\"Tkinter\",\"tcl\", \n                \"_imagingtk\", \"PIL._imagingtk\",\n                \"ImageTk\", \"PIL.ImageTk\", \"FixTk\", \"kinterbasdb\", \n                \"MySQLdb\", 'Numeric', 'OpenGL.GL', 'OpenGL.GLUT',\n                'dbGadfly', 'email.Generator', \n                'email.Iterators', 'email.Utils', 'kinterbasdb', \n                'numarray', 'pymssql', 'pysqlite2', 'wx.BitmapFromImage'], \n                \"includes\": [\"encodings\", \"locale\", \"wx.gizmos\",\"wx.lib.calendar\"]}},\n        zipfile=None,\n        windows=[{'script':'basicApp.py'}], \n        data_files=data_files\n)\n\n","ViewCount":"4275","LastEditorDisplayName":"TheObserver","Title":"Troubleshooting py2exe packaging problem","Tags":"\u003cpython\u003e\u003cuser-interface\u003e\u003cpy2exe\u003e","CommentCount":"0","AnswerCount":"2","AcceptedAnswerId":"218263","Score":"5","OwnerDisplayName":"TheObserver","PostTypeId":"1","FavoriteCount":"1","Id":"217666"}
