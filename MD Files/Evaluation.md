Evaluation Plan  
  
The plan description is divided into the following 3 subsections:  
1) Experimental Setup:  
As our solution comprises of a recommendation system, trying to involve as many users as we can (about 20 atleast) and make them use our application. Our aim would be to assess how accurate our solution is on the basis of the parameters defined below and also how impressed the users are with it. We would be asking the users for their feedback on how good the application is as compared to a simple search on stackoverflow. We have certain parameters to obtain the user’s feedback on, which would help us assess the quality of our solutions.  
2) Assessment Parameters:  
There two groups of parameters for assessment:  
ii) Technical Parameters: These are the parameters that would help us evaluate how well the 3 solutions perform against each other and against a simple search on stackoverflow. The various parameters are:  
a) Hit Rate: The number of times our top 5 recommendations provide the needed solutions for the user.  
b) Post Match: The index of the desired post in all the posts our recommendation system recommends. (Top 5, Top 20, Top 50, Top 100)  
c) Cluster Match Rate: The number of times the desired post is present in the cluster of posts our recommendation system returns. (Top 100)  
ii) Parameters for User Feedback: These are the parameters that would help us evaluate the user’s feedback in qualitative terms. The various parameters are:  
a) Best Solution: Out of our 3 solutions and a simple search on stackoverflow.  
b) Would You Recommend it to Others?: User’s perception on the importance and usability of this project.  
c) Rate the Solution: Rating on a scale of 1-5 for each of the solutions and a simple search on stackoverflow.  
d) Handling Overhead: Does the overhead of setup and handling the project make the user less likely to use it?  
e) Additional Comments: Any other comments the user has for the project as a whole or for a particular component of the project.  
  
3) Overall Evaluation: After obtaining the required parameters we would be blending them to produce a score for each of the solutions and a simple stackoverflow search. This score would be a broad measure of:  
a) Usability  
b) User Experience  
c) Optimality  
d) Accuracy  
This would help us understand how the project fares in the market and what things we can change to make it better!
