Once you are using their copies and pastes however it performs just like normal copy and paste; however, you can choose to show your history at the bottom of the screen like so:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 47 21 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923245/fe09324c-cf22-11e5-8266-5f4126ec303f.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the screenshot it handles indents through a special backslash, so while you can just fast copy from this box at the bottom if you want to preserve indents you must use their special commands for traversing the history and paste from that (an inconvenience). You can see where the history is currently pointed at from the big arrow on line 1.\r\n\r\nOverall the plugin is nice but I don't like how it goes as far as to add a visual GUI component but you can only interact with it correctly through commands. This may be a larger problem with Sublime extensions on the whole though.\r\n"}

Alternatively like the other plug-in you can use commands to navigate the history so your next paste pastes from the current  index.

Finally make sure to include relevant tables and graphs from our data and reference them in your discussion.\r\n\r\nAlso just as a reminder the data is all in the \"experimental data\" google sheet on drive, there are 2 sheets and the second sheet is actually where the interesting data is because it shows times per task per feature.\r\n\r\nFinally one last note is that the person I had for control/normal definitely tried way too hard to finish quickly so her data might throw some stuff off.\r\n\r\nAlso no need to specifically call out a best feature in your results section, as the discussion section will focus more on which feature was the best, etc.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"}

We could just make individual figures for each group but that adds 18 figures (eek), for \"changes_per_commit\" I went ahead and made a full graphic with all 6 to show how it looks so you can check it out in the document.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"}
